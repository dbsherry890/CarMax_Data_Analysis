# Ultramarathon Analysis

### Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis on a Kaggle dataset

This dataset includes information on international ultramarathons. It contains features such as length, location, and date.

The goal of this project was to:

1. Clean this messy dataset that has several columns with un-uniform information
2. Answer some key questions of interest <br>
   Which countries offer the longest races?
   Which races take the longest to finish on average?
